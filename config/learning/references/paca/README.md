## What is Paca?

Paca is a **self-hosted project management platform** where AI agents and humans collaborate as equal teammates inside a Scrum team — not as chatbots bolted on the side.

Jira gives you a backlog. ClickUp gives you automations. Monday gives you dashboards. **Paca gives your AI agents a seat at the table.** They join sprint planning, pick up tasks from the board, write BDD specs, and adapt alongside humans in real time.

Everything about Paca — its workflow, its data model, its UI — is **configurable and extendable via plugins**.

---

## Why Paca?

| | Jira / Trello / ClickUp / Monday | **Paca** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **AI integration** | Chatbot add-ons, peripheral automation | AI agents as first-class Scrum teammates |
| **Collaboration model** | Human-only by default | Human + AI, side by side on the same board |
| **Hosting** | Vendor cloud (your data, their servers) | Self-hosted, you own everything |
| **Cost** | $8–$20+ per seat/month | **Free forever** |
| **Customization** | Limited; locked behind enterprise tiers | **Fully open: configuration + plugins** |
| **Weight** | Bloated feature sprawl | Lightweight core; extend only what you need |
| **Source** | Closed / proprietary | **100% open-source (Apache 2.0)** |

---

## Core Idea: Humans and AI Agents, One Scrum Team

The central insight behind Paca is that **AI agents should participate in the Scrum process**, not just generate output in isolation.

In Paca, AI agents:

- Are **assigned to sprints** and appear on the Scrumban board alongside human teammates
- **Pick up tasks** from the backlog and update their status in real time
- **Collaborate on BDD specs** — helping Product Owners and BAs write Gherkin scenarios
- **Contribute to System Design Documents** — keeping the architecture visible to the whole team
- **Probe, sense, and respond** to emerging complexity, just like a human would

This is not automation. It is **genuine collaboration** — rooted in the Cynefin / Stacey framework's recognition that complex domains require teams, not pipelines.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/demo-assign-task.gif" width="720" alt="Paca Demo — AI Agents as Real Scrum Teammates on the Scrumban Board" />
</p>

---

## Fully Customizable — Configuration and Plugins

Paca ships as a small, focused core. Everything else is optional.

**Configuration-driven:** workflows, statuses, field definitions, board layouts, sprint rules, and agent behavior are all driven by project-level configuration files. No code needed to adapt Paca to your team's process.

**Plugin system:** extend or replace any part of Paca via plugins. Plugins are compiled to **WebAssembly (WASM)** for the backend (write in Go, Rust, AssemblyScript — anything with a WASM target) and standard module bundles for the frontend. Plugins run in a sandboxed environment with a capability-based permission model; they declare exactly what host functions they need, and nothing more.

```
plugins/
├── backend/        # WASM modules — add custom routes, logic, data models
└── frontend/       # UI modules — add custom pages, board views, widgets
```

Browse and install community plugins directly from the **Plugin Marketplace** inside the Paca UI — no command line required. Go to **Settings → Plugins → Marketplace**, find a plugin, and click **Install**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/demo-plugin-marketplace.gif" width="720" alt="Paca Plugin Marketplace — Install Community Plugins in One Click" />
</p>

For local development or custom plugins, you can also install from the filesystem:

```bash
./scripts/install-local-plugin.sh ./my-plugin --api-key <your-api-key>
```

---

## The P-A-C-A Cycle

Paca structures team collaboration around four phases that mirror both Scrum and the scientific method:

```
Plan  →  Act  →  Check  →  Adapt
  ↑                             |
  └─────────────────────────────┘
```

| Phase | What happens |
|:--|:--|
| **Plan** | POs, BAs, and AI agents collaboratively refine the backlog. BDD scenarios and SDD designs are written together. |
| **Act** | Sprint is live. Humans and AI agents pull tasks from the board, execute, and post updates. |
| **Check** | QA agents run automated verification. Humans review AI output. The board reflects reality. |
| **Adapt** | Data from the sprint informs the next cycle. The team — human and AI — retrospects together. |

## What's New in v0.17.0

- **Jev AI integration** — plug [Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai), an AI decision engine, into any project to let it make the small routing calls a team makes all day. It's opt-in and per-project: bring your own key for TypeSafe (the default) or any Jev-compatible provider such as [OpenJev](https://openjev.sh/docs) from **Settings → Jev AI**. The key is encrypted at rest and never shown again, and a project without a key behaves exactly as before.
  - **Agent Auto-routing** — pick **Auto** in the chat's agent picker and Jev hands your message to the best-fit agent, based on each agent's description.
  - **Task Auto-fill** — when a task is created, Jev fills in the fields left blank (priority, type, story points, tags, epic, and select/boolean custom fields). It only applies confident answers and never overwrites a field a person set.
  - **Task Auto-assign** — set a task's assignee to **Auto** and Jev picks the best-matching member from their descriptions. If it isn't confident, it leaves the task unassigned and says why in the activity feed.
  - **Jev Condition in automations** — a new condition node that routes a workflow on Jev's answer (a choice, a score, or yes/no), falling back to the **Else** branch whenever Jev is unsure or unavailable.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/demo-jev.gif" width="720" alt="Paca v0.17.0 — Jev AI: Agent Auto-routing, Task Auto-fill, Auto-assign, and Jev Conditions" />
</p>

---

## What's New in v0.15.0

- **Browser extension for page annotations** — comment directly on an element of a running [environment](docs/ai-agent/environment-management.md)'s preview page, right on the page itself, and turn any comment into a real Paca task in one click. It authenticates through your existing Paca session — no separate login — via the same-hostname cookie trick documented in [apps/extension/README.md](apps/extension/README.md). Install the pre-built zip from each [release](https://github.com/Paca-AI/paca/releases), or build it from source.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/demo-browser-extension.gif" width="720" alt="Paca v0.15.0 — Browser Extension for Commenting on Environment Previews" />
</p>

- **`provider_cli` agent type** — run an agent on a CLI you're already logged into — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, or Cursor CLI — inside one of its own static environments. Log into the CLI once from the environment's terminal (a static environment, because the CLI's own login has to persist across conversations), and Paca drives that CLI directly for every conversation afterward, syncing your configured MCP servers into its config along the way.

---

## What's New in v0.14.0

- **Static environments** — create a named, long-lived container that persists independently of any single conversation: agents attach to it instead of spinning up a fresh disposable sandbox, so files on disk and background processes survive across chats. Reach a running environment through an in-browser terminal, real SSH with per-environment authorized keys, or user-managed port forwards to preview a live dev server — on both self-hosted Docker Compose and Kubernetes/Helm. See [docs/ai-agent/environment-management.md](docs/ai-agent/environment-management.md) for the full design.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/demo-environments.gif" width="720" alt="Paca v0.14.0 — Static Environments with Terminal, SSH, and Port Forwarding" />
</p>

---

## What's New in v0.12.0

- **Workspace branding** — customize your workspace's logo, favicon, and primary accent color from **Settings → Workspace Branding**. Upload a logo and favicon (PNG, JPEG, WEBP, or GIF, up to 5 MB) and pick from a curated set of accent colors, each with matching light- and dark-mode variants applied automatically across buttons, highlights, the sidebar, and the login screen.

---

## What's New in v0.11.0

- **Event-driven automation engine** — a complete redesign of the automation system into a visual, n8n-style graph builder. Compose **Trigger → Condition → Action** flows on an interactive canvas with multi-branch switch logic, an `Else` fallback path, and nine built-in trigger types — including UTC cron schedules, due-date offsets, task-dependency gates, and inbound webhooks with secret-token auth. Actions can **retarget linked tasks** (parent, children, blockers, or explicit picks) with automatic fan-out, **dispatch AI agents** with custom prompts, or **call external APIs**. Every run is traced step-by-step in a new **Run History** panel, and a project-wide **Dependency Map** visualizes cross-task automation relationships. Plugins can contribute custom trigger, condition, and action node types via WASM.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/demo-automation-workflow.png" width="720" alt="Paca v0.11.0 — Event-Driven Automation Engine with Visual Graph Builder" />
</p>

---

## What's New in v0.10.0

- **ACP agent support** — connect any [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) coding CLI as a Paca AI agent: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, or a custom ACP server. A lightweight local bridge (`paca-acp-bridge`) runs from your project's source directory and streams the conversation back to Paca over an authenticated WebSocket — no code is cloned into a cloud sandbox, and the agent uses your own local auth, git/`gh` credentials, and whatever MCP servers or skills you've already set up for that CLI. See [apps/acp-bridge/README.md](apps/acp-bridge/README.md) for setup.

---

---

## What's New in v0.4.0

- **In-app AI chat** — chat with AI agents at the project level to plan work, create or update epics, stories, tasks, and documentation — all in plain English without leaving Paca

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/demo-ai-chat.gif" width="720" alt="Paca v0.4.0 — In-app AI Chat for Project Planning and Task Management" />
</p>

- **Activity diff & revert** — every field change in the activity pane now shows a before/after diff; one click reverts a change to its previous value

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/demo-activity-diff-revert.gif" width="720" alt="Paca v0.4.0 — Activity Diff and Revert" />
</p>

---

## Key Features

- **Unified Scrumban Board** — humans and AI agents share a single real-time board; no separate "AI workspace"
- **In-app AI chat** — chat with AI agents at the project level to plan work, create or update epics, stories, tasks, and documentation in plain English
- **Activity diff & revert** — see a visual diff for every field change in the activity pane and revert any change with one click
- **BDD Collaboration** — Gherkin scenario editor co-authored by POs, BAs, and AI agents
- **System Design Documents (SDD)** — living architecture docs that keep AI agents contextually grounded
- **MCP Server** — connect Claude, custom agents, or any MCP-compatible tool directly into Paca's data layer
- **Claude Code skill** — `/paca` slash command for Claude Code; manage tasks, docs, and sprints in plain English without leaving your editor
- **Real-time updates** — Socket.IO delivery; everyone sees changes the moment they happen
- **OpenHands-powered agents** — AI agents run on the [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands) SDK; each agent executes inside its own isolated sandbox container so your host environment is never touched
- **WASM plugin sandbox** — extend Paca safely; plugins cannot escape their declared permissions
- **Self-hosted** — runs on a single Docker Compose command; your data never leaves your infrastructure
- **Lightweight by default** — minimal core, no feature bloat; add only what your team actually needs

---

## Getting Started

### Option 1 — Interactive install script (recommended for production)

Runs on any Linux server with Docker. No repository clone required.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Paca-AI/paca/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

The script walks you through configuration interactively and starts the full stack. Open `http://your-server-ip` when it finishes.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/demo-install.gif" width="720" alt="How to Install Paca on Any Linux Server with One Command" />
</p>

**Non-interactive (CI, scripts, AI coding agents):** set `PACA_YES=1` — required for
unattended use, since without it the script can block on a prompt with nobody there
to answer it. Every other setting (database, storage, domain/HTTPS, AI agent, secrets)
can be steered with an environment variable instead of accepting its default:

```bash
PACA_YES=1 bash <(curl -fsSL https://github.com/Paca-AI/paca/releases/latest/download/install.sh)
```

> **If you are an AI agent installing Paca on someone's behalf:** use this script
> rather than hand-writing `docker-compose.yml` / `.env` yourself — it pins
> compatible image tags and generates every secret in the format the services
> expect, so it's far less likely to drift from what a given release needs. See
> [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md#non-interactive-install-ci-scripts-ai-coding-agents)
> for the full environment variable reference, or the comment header at the top of
> [`scripts/install.sh`](scripts/install.sh) for the same reference inline with the script.
>
> Prefer a manual Docker Compose setup, or a local dev environment instead? See
> [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md#manual-setup) and
> [docs/guides/local-development.md](docs/guides/local-development.md).

---

### Upgrading to a new version

From the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` live, run the upgrade
script published with each release — it refreshes `docker-compose.yml` and the
Caddyfile (with backups) and restarts the stack:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Paca-AI/paca/releases/latest/download/upgrade.sh -o upgrade.sh
bash upgrade.sh
```

Database migrations run automatically on API startup. Non-interactive (CI, AI agents): set `PACA_YES=1`, same as `install.sh` — see [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md#upgrading-to-a-new-version) for the full env var reference, pinning a specific version, or passing through `--scale` flags.

---

### Option 2 — Kubernetes (Helm chart)

For running Paca on an existing Kubernetes cluster instead of a single Docker host. No repository clone required — the chart is published as an OCI artifact alongside every other release image.

```bash
kubectl create namespace paca
helm install paca oci://ghcr.io/paca-ai/charts/paca --version <release-version> -n paca -f my-values.yaml
```

`<release-version>` is a [release](https://github.com/Paca-AI/paca/releases) tag without its leading `v` (e.g. `0.13.1` for `v0.13.1`); omit `--version` to install the newest chart published. At minimum, `my-values.yaml` needs `publicUrl` and the required secrets (`jwtSecret`, `adminPassword`, `encryptionKey`, and others) — there are no guessable defaults, so the chart refuses to render without them.

See [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/paca/paca) for the full values reference, exposing the app via Ingress/TLS or a LoadBalancer, what's bundled vs. pointing at managed Postgres/Redis/S3, the AI agent sandbox's Kubernetes-specific RBAC, and troubleshooting.

---

## MCP Server — Connect Any AI Agent to Paca

Paca ships an [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that gives any compatible AI agent direct, structured access to your workspace — projects, tasks, sprints, documents, members, and more. No scraping, no custom APIs to wire up.

The server is published as **`@paca-ai/paca-mcp`** on npm. You run it with `npx`; your MCP client handles the rest.

### Claude Desktop

1. Open (or create) the Claude Desktop config file:
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the `paca` entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paca": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@paca-ai/paca-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PACA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "PACA_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop. Claude now has access to all Paca tools and can answer requests like:
   - *"List all active sprints in project X"*
   - *"Create a task for implementing OAuth and assign it to sprint 3"*
   - *"Add a comment to task #42 with my progress update"*

### Other MCP-Compatible Clients

Any client that speaks MCP works. Typical configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "paca",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@paca-ai/paca-mcp"],
  "env": {
    "PACA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
    "PACA_API_URL": "http://your-paca-instance:8080"
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `PACA_API_KEY` | Yes | — | API key from your Paca instance (Settings → API Keys) |
| `PACA_API_URL` | No | `http://localhost:8080` | URL of your Paca API |

### Available Tools

The server exposes tools across these categories:

| Category | Tools |
|:--|:--|
| Projects | `list_projects`, `get_project`, `create_project`, `update_project`, `delete_project` |
| Tasks | `list_tasks`, `get_task`, `create_task`, `update_task`, `delete_task`, + more |
| Sprints | `list_sprints`, `create_sprint`, `update_sprint`, `complete_sprint`, + more |
| Documents | `list_documents`, `get_document`, `create_document`, `update_document`, `delete_document` |
| Members & Roles | `list_project_members`, `add_project_member`, `list_project_roles`, + more |
| Task Types & Statuses | `list_task_types`, `create_task_type`, `list_task_statuses`, + more |
| Views & Custom Fields | `list_views`, `create_view`, `list_custom_fields`, `create_custom_field`, + more |
| Attachments | `list_task_attachments`, `get_attachment_download_url`, `delete_task_attachment` |
| Activity & Comments | `list_task_activities`, `add_task_comment`, `update_task_comment`, `delete_task_comment` |
| Plugin tools | Installed plugins can register additional tools at runtime |

For a complete reference and advanced configuration (agent-mode, plugin tools, programmatic usage), see [docs/guides/mcp-server-setup.md](docs/guides/mcp-server-setup.md).

## `/paca` skills — Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and more

Install the Paca skill set and manage your entire Paca workspace through natural-language slash commands — without leaving your editor and without creating local files. Every command reads your Paca documentation first to understand the project before acting.

Skills use the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) format (YAML frontmatter + instructions) and are served by a running Paca instance's own API (`GET /api/v1/skills`), not read from a checked-out directory — so installed content always matches the exact version that instance runs. The install script fetches and installs them to [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (`~/.claude/commands/`), Gemini CLI (`~/.gemini/commands/`), Cursor (`.cursor/commands/`, project-scoped), and any AGENTS.md-reading tool (project-scoped) in one pass, and also pulls in skills contributed by your installed plugins. See [docs/guides/install-skills.md](docs/guides/install-skills.md) for details.

### Install

Point the installer at a running Paca instance and run this once in your terminal to install all skills to every supported platform found on this machine:

```bash
PACA_API_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Paca-AI/paca/master/scripts/install-paca-skills.sh | bash
```

Then connect the Paca MCP server to Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add paca \
  --env PACA_API_KEY=<your-api-key> \
  --env PACA_API_URL=<your-paca-url> \
  -- npx -y @paca-ai/paca-mcp
```

Run `/paca-setup` inside a Claude Code session for a guided interactive walkthrough instead.

### Available commands

| Command | What it does |
|:--|:--|
| `/paca <request>` | General task, doc, and sprint operations in plain English |
| `/paca-epic <requirements>` | Turn requirements into an epic with child stories and a spec doc |
| `/paca-clarify <task-or-doc>` | Identify ambiguities, ask questions, and update the spec in Paca |
| `/paca-breakdown <task>` | Decompose a task into independent, estimable sub-tasks |
| `/paca-sprint` | Plan a sprint from the backlog against capacity and goals |
| `/paca-estimate <task(s)>` | Estimate story points and write them back to tasks |
| `/paca-prioritize` | Score and set priorities across the backlog |
| `/paca-do <task>` | Execute a task, update its status, and keep docs current |
| `/paca-test <task>` | Derive test cases, run them, and record results as a comment |
| `/paca-doc <task-or-topic>` | Write or update documentation in Paca Docs |
| `/paca-setup` | Interactive MCP connection wizard |

For full setup options and command reference, see [docs/guides/install-skills.md](docs/guides/install-skills.md).

## The "Paca" Story

The name is a small pun on the Japanese word **"Baka" (ばか)** — "silly."

In the early days, we jokingly called our AI assistants "silly" when they hallucinated. And building a serious project management platform as a free, open-source alternative to multi-billion-dollar tools might also seem a bit silly.

But Paca is built from conviction: human-AI collaboration in a real Scrum team should be accessible to every team, everywhere — not locked behind a vendor's pricing model. We think that's worth being a little foolish about. 🦙✨
