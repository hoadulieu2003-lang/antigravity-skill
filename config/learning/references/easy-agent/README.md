# Easy Agent

A terminal coding agent that reads your code, edits files, and runs commands under permission rules you control.

![Easy Agent banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConardLi/easy-agent/main/public/img/banner.jpeg)

Easy Agent (`eagent`) runs in your terminal next to your repository. Describe a task and it plans the work, reads and changes files, runs tests or shell commands, and reports back. Every action that can change your machine goes through permission rules, workspace trust, and an optional OS-level sandbox. It works with Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, Gemini, and local models.

The code is written to be read as well as run. Model communication, the agentic loop, tools, permissions, context management, and each extension system live in separate layers. The documents linked below explain how the security-relevant parts behave and why, and the [learning path](./docs/learning-path.md) walks through the layers in order with code snapshots, which helps if you want to build or customize an agent of your own.

## What you can use it for

- Find your way around an unfamiliar codebase: ask where something is handled, how a flow works, or what a change would touch.
- Make multi-file changes, review the diff, and undo them with `/rewind` if they are wrong.
- Run builds and tests, read the failures, and iterate on a fix.
- Plan a change first in read-only Plan Mode, then carry it out.
- Script it: pipe input into `eagent -p` and read text, JSON, or NDJSON output in CI or shell scripts.
- Connect your own tools through MCP servers, skills, custom agents, hooks, and plugins.

## Install

Requirements: Node.js 22 or newer, npm, and credentials for at least one supported model provider.

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts eagent
eagent --version
```

Or try it without installing:

```bash
npx --yes eagent@latest
```

On macOS and Linux an installer is also available. It checks Node.js, installs the same npm package with `--ignore-scripts`, and verifies that `eagent` is on `PATH`. It does not install Node.js or run package lifecycle scripts.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConardLi/easy-agent/main/install.sh | sh
```

The package installs two commands, `eagent` and the long alias `easy-agent`.

## Quick start

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="your-token"
cd your-project
eagent
```

On first use in a folder, Easy Agent asks whether you trust it. Then type a request, for example `explain how requests are authenticated in this repo`. Type `/help` for commands; press Ctrl+D to exit.

## Core capabilities

- File and code tools: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Glob, Grep, Bash, and PowerShell on Windows
- Web and external tools: WebFetch, WebSearch, [MCP tools and resources](./docs/mcp.md)
- Safe execution: allow/ask/deny rules, Plan Mode, Auto Mode, workspace trust, [hooks](./docs/hooks.md), [controlled subprocesses](./docs/subprocesses.md), [private local data](./docs/local-data-security.md), and [fail-closed shell sandboxing](./docs/sandbox-security.md) on macOS and Linux
- Long-running work: TodoWrite, persistent task graphs, sub-agents, background runs, Git worktree isolation, and [Agent Teams](./docs/agent-teams.md)
- Context and continuity: [durable persistence](./docs/persistence.md), resume, compaction, token budgets, project memory (`AGENTS.md` / `AGENT.md`), file checkpoints, and rewind
- Extensibility: skills, custom agents, slash commands, output styles, hooks, MCP servers, plugins, and static marketplaces
- Interfaces: interactive terminal UI, [headless text/JSON/NDJSON output](./docs/headless-output.md), an embeddable [session SDK](./docs/sdk.md) (`eagent/sdk`), images and screenshots, and multiple model protocols

## Supported platforms

| Platform | Status | Shell tool | Shell sandbox |
|---|---|---|---|
| macOS | Supported | Bash | Seatbelt; needs `rg` |
| Linux, WSL2 | Supported | Bash | bubblewrap; needs `bubblewrap`, `socat`, `rg`, and unprivileged user namespaces |
| Windows | Supported without sandbox | PowerShell | Not available; an enabled fail-closed sandbox blocks PowerShell |

- Node.js 22 or newer is required on every platform. Older versions exit with an explanatory message.
- The `install.sh` installer supports macOS and Linux. On Windows, install with npm.
- On Windows, local data relies on the user profile's ACLs instead of POSIX `0600`/`0700` modes. `/doctor` reports this.
- Clipboard image paste needs `pngpaste` or `osascript` on macOS and `xclip` or `xsel` on Linux.

See [Sandbox security](./docs/sandbox-security.md) for per-platform setup, including the Ubuntu AppArmor restriction on user namespaces.

## Security model

Easy Agent assumes the model can make mistakes and that a repository you open may be hostile. Several independent layers limit what a session can do:

- **Permission rules.** Tool calls that change files, run commands, or reach the network are checked against allow, ask, and deny rules. Deny rules always win. In the default mode anything not allowed is asked; Bash commands that are proven read-only can run without a prompt ([analysis rules](./docs/bash-read-only-security.md)).
- **Permission modes.** `default` asks before risky actions. `plan` (`--plan`) allows only read-only tools. `auto` (`--auto`) lets a classifier approve safe calls, block risky ones, and fall back to a prompt when unsure. Headless runs (`-p`) deny calls that would prompt unless you pass `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; deny rules still apply.
- **Workspace trust.** Project settings, `.env`, project MCP servers, hooks, plugins, and model profiles are ignored until you trust the folder. Trust is stored in your home directory, so a repository cannot mark itself trusted, and project files cannot replace credentials inherited from your shell ([details](./docs/configuration-security.md)).
- **Path boundaries.** File tools resolve real paths and refuse to follow symbolic links out of the workspace and its allowed directories ([details](./docs/workspace-path-security.md)).
- **Shell sandbox.** When `sandbox.enabled` is set, Bash runs inside an OS sandbox with an allow-only write policy and proxy-filtered network. If the sandbox cannot start, the command is blocked rather than run unsandboxed ([details](./docs/sandbox-security.md)).
- **Local data.** Sessions, settings, trust state, and logs are private to your account. Stream debug logging is off unless you enable it and redacts credentials when on ([details](./docs/local-data-security.md)).

Easy Agent sends no analytics or telemetry. Network requests go to the model provider you configure, to MCP servers and plugin sources you add, and to WebFetch/WebSearch targets when those tools are allowed. `/doctor` probes the configured provider endpoint for reachability.

## Configuration

Settings are JSON files merged in this order, from lowest to highest priority:

1. User: `~/.easy-agent/settings.json`
2. Project: `<project>/.easy-agent/settings.json` (shared, applied once the folder is trusted)
3. Local: `<project>/.easy-agent/settings.local.json` (personal, applied once the folder is trusted)
4. Command line: `--settings <file>`, `--model`, `--permission-mode`, and similar flags
5. Managed policy: `/Library/Application Support/EasyAgent/managed-settings.json` on macOS, `/etc/easy-agent/managed-settings.json` on Linux, `%PROGRAMDATA%\EasyAgent\managed-settings.json` on Windows

A project `.env` is applied after project and local settings, only for a trusted folder. Feature switches are described in [Configuration and feature controls](./docs/configuration.md).

For a raw Anthropic model name, environment variables are enough:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="your-token"
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="claude-sonnet-4-20250514" # optional
eagent
```

Named Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, Gemini, and local profiles go in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "defaultModel": "gpt",
  "models": {
    "gpt": {
      "protocol": "openai-chat",
      "model": "gpt-5.1",
      "baseURL": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
      "apiKey": "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
    },
    "gemini": {
      "protocol": "gemini",
      "model": "gemini-2.5-pro",
      "apiKey": "${GEMINI_API_KEY}"
    },
    "ollama": {
      "protocol": "openai-chat",
      "model": "qwen2.5-coder",
      "baseURL": "http://localhost:11434/v1"
    }
  }
}
```

Select a profile with `eagent --model gpt` or `/model gpt` inside the REPL.

| Environment variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | Anthropic API token or compatible gateway token |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | Optional Anthropic-compatible endpoint |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | Default raw Anthropic model name |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Referenced by OpenAI-compatible profiles |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Referenced by Gemini profiles |
| `WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY` | Optional WebSearch provider key |

Run `/config list`, `/model list`, or `/doctor` to inspect the effective setup. Credential values are always redacted.

## Where data is stored

| Location | Contents |
|---|---|
| `~/.easy-agent/settings.json` | User settings |
| `~/.easy-agent/state.json` | Workspace trust decisions and machine-level state |
| `~/.easy-agent/AGENT.md` | User-wide memory loaded into every session |
| `~/.easy-agent/projects/` | Session transcripts (JSONL) and per-project memory |
| `~/.easy-agent/file-history/` | File checkpoints used by `/rewind` |
| `~/.easy-agent/tasks/`, `plans/`, `teams/` | Task graphs, Plan Mode plans, Agent Team state |
| `~/.easy-agent/skills/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `output-styles/` | User extensions |
| `~/.easy-agent/plugins/`, `mcp/` | Installed plugins, MCP OAuth tokens and artifacts |
| `~/.easy-agent/stream-debug.log` | Only when `EASY_AGENT_DEBUG_STREAM=1` is set |
| `<project>/.easy-agent/` | Project settings, local settings, and project extensions |
| `<project>/AGENTS.md`, `<project>/AGENT.md` | Project memory you write or create with `/init`; both load when present, `AGENTS.md` first |
| `<git root>/.easy-agent/worktrees/` | Git worktrees for isolated sub-agents |

On macOS and Linux, `~/.easy-agent` is created with mode `0700` and sensitive files with `0600`. Removing the npm package keeps this directory; delete it yourself to remove all data.

## Common usage

```bash
eagent                         # interactive REPL
eagent --model gpt             # select a model profile
eagent --plan                  # read-only planning mode
eagent --auto                  # classifier-assisted permission mode
eagent --resume                # resume the latest session
eagent --resume <session-id>   # resume a specific session
eagent -p "summarize this repo"                 # headless text output
eagent --trust-project-config -p "summarize this repo" # allow reviewed project config once
eagent -p "list the tools" --output-format json # machine-readable output
git diff | eagent -p "review this patch"         # combine stdin and a prompt
```

Structured JSON and NDJSON messages follow the versioned [headless output schema](./docs/headless-output.md). Unknown cost is reported as `null`, not as a measured zero.

Run `eagent --help` for every startup option. Useful REPL commands include:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/help` | List commands and shortcuts |
| `/model`, `/mode`, `/think`, `/effort` | Control model and reasoning behavior |
| `/config`, `/status`, `/doctor`, `/context` | Inspect configuration and runtime health |
| `/resume`, `/history`, `/export`, `/copy` | Work with sessions and output |
| `/rewind`, `/diff` | Inspect or restore file changes |
| `/permissions` | Inspect permission rules |
| `/skills`, `/agents`, `/hooks`, `/mcp` | Inspect extension registries |
| `/plugin`, `/marketplace` | Install and manage plugins |
| `/memory` | Inspect or edit project memory |

## Upgrade and uninstall

Upgrade the global package, or re-run the installer:

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts eagent@latest
```

Remove it with:

```bash
npm uninstall -g eagent
```

User configuration and sessions under `~/.easy-agent/` are intentionally preserved when the npm package is removed.

## Troubleshooting

1. Run `eagent --version` and confirm Node.js with `node --version`.
2. Run `/doctor` inside Easy Agent to inspect credentials, settings, MCP, plugins, sandbox support, and writable paths.
3. Run `/status` and `/config list` to verify the active model and configuration sources.
4. If a global install succeeds but `eagent` is not found, add the npm global bin directory associated with `npm prefix -g` to `PATH`, then open a new shell.
5. Report reproducible problems through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ConardLi/easy-agent/issues).

Never include API keys, `.env` contents, or private prompts in an issue.

## Architecture

Easy Agent keeps five runtime layers separate:

```text
Terminal UI
    ↓
QueryEngine (multi-turn orchestration)
    ↓
Agentic Loop (reason → tool → observe)
    ↓
Tools and permission enforcement
    ↓
Provider API and streaming adapters
```

The npm package ships a single readable ESM bundle with a source map (paths only, no embedded sources), so stack traces in bug reports point at real source lines. Licenses of bundled third-party code are in `dist/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`. The version-pinned `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` dependency supplies the platform helpers for process isolation.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ConardLi/easy-agent.git
cd easy-agent
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run verify:production` is the offline pull-request gate and `npm run verify:release` is the full release gate. See [Testing](./docs/testing.md) and [Releasing](./docs/releasing.md).
