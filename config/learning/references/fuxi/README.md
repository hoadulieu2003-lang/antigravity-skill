FuXi is a fast, self-contained **terminal AI coding agent**. It reads code, edits
files, runs commands, and drives tools from a rich TUI, with cost-aware routing
across LLM providers and automatic failover. Built in Go, it ships as one static
binary with no runtime dependencies.

**Terminal-first** · **Provider-agnostic** · **Bring your own key** · **MCP client** · **Self-updating**

## Install

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://downloads.fuxicode.com/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
irm https://downloads.fuxicode.com/bootstrap.ps1 | iex
```

**Windows (CMD)**

```bat
curl -fsSL https://downloads.fuxicode.com/install.cmd -o "%TEMP%\fuxi-install.cmd" && "%TEMP%\fuxi-install.cmd"
```

Then verify and launch:

```bash
fuxi --version
fuxi doctor    # environment sanity checks
fuxi           # start a session
```

Install and upgrade are the same command. Full options, uninstall steps, and
troubleshooting: [setup docs](docs/usage.md#installation).

## Get started

A FuXi account is required. Run `fuxi`, then:

1. **Register and sign in** — `fuxi login` (or `fuxi setup-token` for
   headless/CI). Registration processes only minimal account data.
2. **Connect a model (optional)** — sign-in gives access to FuXi-managed models;
   to use your own provider instead, set an API key via environment variable or
   `~/.fuxi/config.yaml` (`fuxi init` generates a template). Or run `fuxi wizard`.

Then type a prompt and press Enter, for example:

```text
Fix the failing tests in this repository.
```

Useful commands: `/model` switch models · `/help` browse all commands ·
`/config` open settings · `/privacy-settings` privacy controls · `/exit` quit.

Full walkthrough: [usage guide](docs/usage.md).

## Data, privacy, and retention

FuXi runs on your machine and keeps your work local.

- **By default, your code and conversations are never collected, stored, or
  retained by FuXi.** With your own key they go straight to the provider you
  choose; with FuXi-managed models they are transmitted only to serve that
  request. Conversation content is sent to FuXi only if you explicitly enable
  `send_conversations` (off by default).
- **Credentials stay in local `~/.fuxi/`** and are never uploaded.
- **Sessions, checkpoints, memory, and audit logs** live on your device and can
  be deleted at any time by removing the config directory.
- FuXi processes limited account and technical information to operate the
  service; the available analytics are disclosed and can be turned off. See
  [Privacy Controls](security-privacy/DATA_PROTECTION.md).
